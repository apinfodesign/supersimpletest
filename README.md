# supersimpletest

Test: You have up to two hours to put together a full stack app.

This is an assessment of your ability to write full stack JavaScript web applications. Do not work with other students on this project; we want to see your individual ability to write code.

For this project, you'll create an image gallery web application.

1 Users will be able to submit a text description (caption) for an image and a link to that image.
 DONE
 
2 Users should be able to add link/caption data, one at a time, to build up their image gallery.
  DONE
  
  Important Note: You do not have to let a user submit actual image data; accept just a link (i.e., a URL) to the image.

3 The links and captions should be saved on a sever, and the web browser should retrieve images using the images' links, and render the images in the browser. 
 DONE mongolabs
 
4 Use server-side data storage (such as Mongo), and make the image links and captions persistent, i.e., if the user restarts the browser and navigates to your web site, he/she should see all of the images and captions previously posted.
 DONE
 
5Design a single-page app that shows images and lets users submit new links/captions (not a separate requirement, just restating above in context of SPA).
DONE

6 Use whatever tools you want to accomplish the task, but make sure you include tests (e.g. mocha) and use git/GitHub for version control.
NOT DONE

Requirements: Web server code, server-side database, REST API, client-side JavaScript and HTML (you can use any client-side library/framework (e.g. angular) you like).

Authentication is not required.

You do not need to deploy to an external server.

This test is "open book" and you can Google or look at code in other repositories, but you must complete this as an individual coding effort. You can take this test on campus or off-campus (honor system!) at any time before the deadline time.
This test should take 1 to 2 hours to complete.
